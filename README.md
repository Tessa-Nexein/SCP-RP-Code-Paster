## How to Use

You can run the script in two ways:

### Option 1: Prompt mode
```bash
python main.py
```

- The script will ask for a filename.
- Press **Enter** to use the default (`example.txt`).
- Or type `clipboard` to use what's in your clipboard.
- Or type any filename present in the `/codes` folder

---

### Option 2: With Parameters
```bash
python main.py myfile.txt
```

- Automatically uses `codes/example.txt`
- Skips the prompt and goes straight to hotkey wait

You can also use:
```bash
python main.py clipboard
```
This reads your clipboard and uses it instead of a file.

---

## Hotkey Controls

- **`F10`** = Start pasting lines (can be changed in the code)
- **`Enter`** = Proceed to next line
- **`Esc`** = Exit the program

The script presses the SCP:RP's **Command Line Key** (`√°` by default) before typing each line. You can change this key if needed in the script:
```python
command_line_key = '√°'
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Make sure Roblox is **already running** and not minimized.
- If Roblox runs as **Administrator**, you must run this script as Administrator too.
- Lines are typed one at a time, after each, **press Enter** to continue.
- Make sure your `codes/` folder exists or is auto-created.

---

## Customization Tips

- Change `START_HOTKEY` or `COMMAND_LINE_KEY` in the script to match your own setup.
- Enable `AUTO_ENTER` and you will not need to press Enter manually.
- Change `DEFAULT_FILE` to your most commonly used Codes.
- Enable `REPEAT_FOR_CLIPBOARD` if you need to Paste from your Clipboard frequently
- Disable `PRESS_ENTER_MESSAGE` if you are already familiar on how to use the Program.
